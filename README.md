## About
IrisM1 is a fork of Iris that's built for Apple Silicon. Simple enough. But when it's compiled natively, the performance benefits can be amazing. The M1 chip family (M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max) is astoundingly capable... but Rosetta has to take care of all of running a lot of applications as of today, including Minecraft Java edition. That's the whole point of this project.
